# Fraudulent Job Analysis
Group 16

This project focuses on identifying patterns or indicators to detect potential fraudulent employment advertisements. 
The patterns and indicators will be discovered through analyzing historical sample data associated with historic employment scams.

The dataset is uploaded in this repository as 'fake_job_postings.zip'. Do extract the csv file and ensure it is in the same working directory before running the codes.

The dataset can also be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0MVfFrW8YL0qOqPvGya-2GmUoJpHc7f/view?usp=share_link).
